Given a sorted array of integers A (0-indexed) of size N, find the left most and the right most index of a given integer B in the array A.

Return an array of size 2, such that :-

First element = Left most index of B in A
Second element = Right most index of B in A.
If B is not found in A, return [-1, -1].

Note : Note: The time complexity of your algorithm must be O(log n).
