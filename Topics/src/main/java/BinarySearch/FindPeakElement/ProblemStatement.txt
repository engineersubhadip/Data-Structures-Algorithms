Problem Description

Given an array of integers A, find and return the peak element in it.
An array element is considered a peak if it is not smaller than its neighbors. For corner elements, we need to consider only one neighbor.

NOTE:

It is guaranteed that the array contains only a single peak element.
Users are expected to solve this in O(log(N)) time. The array may contain duplicate elements.

A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
op : 5

A = [5, 17, 100, 11]
op : 100
